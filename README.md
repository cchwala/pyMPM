pyMPM93
=======

A Python implementation of the millimeter wave propagation model MPM as described in H.J. Liebe, G.A. Hufford, M.G. Cotton, " Propagation modeling of moist air and suspended water/ice particles at frequencies below 1000 GHz," Proc. NATO/AGARD Wave Propagation Panel, 52nd meeting, No. 3/1-10, Mallorca, Spain, 17 - 20 May, 1993.

This implementation is based on the MATLAB version of MPM93 from the developed at the [university of Bern](http://www.iapmw.unibe.ch/teaching/vorlesungen/mikrowellenphysik/software)
